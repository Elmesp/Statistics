## Simulation exercise
```{r}
set.seed(10)
lambda <- 0.2
n <- 40
N <- 500
data <- replicate(N, mean(rexp(n, lambda)))
```
### 1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
```{r}
mean(data) # Sample mean
1/lambda # Theorical mean
```

The sample mean is similar to the theorical mean

### 2. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
```{r}
var(data) # Sample variance
((1 / lambda) / sqrt(n)) ^ 2 # Theorical variance
```

The sample variance is similar to the theorical variance

### 3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
```{r}
qqnorm(data)
qqline(data, col = 2)
```
